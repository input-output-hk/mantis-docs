# How to Contribute to the Mantis Roadmap

## Introduction

The Mantis team at IOHK is hard at work adding exciting features for the Mantis client, and you are welcome to contribute.

## Ways you can help

The Mantis team welcomes offers of help. 

Writing code is valuable, but adding code to the code base can be difficult.

However, there is much more to creating features than writing new code. The developers welcome contributions in these areas:
- Ideas for improvement. The best ideas contribute something specific to benefit all the people who use the Mantis wallet.
- Assessing improvement candidates. Your knowledge and experience can help everyone, including yourself, as you bring your uniqueÂ view to the proposal.
- Reviewing and suggesting improvements to code. A fresh set of eyes can often see something that the team has missed or could be improved.
- Improving documentation. Perhaps you find a topic that is not clear. Perhaps you see that annoying typo. The developers would love to hear from you.
