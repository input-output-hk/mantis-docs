# How to configure the Mantis client

This section outlines how to configure the Mantis client. The Mantis client is flexible and its runtime behavior can be controlled using three main methods:

 - preconfigured config files
 - creating a custom config file
 - configuring runtime with command line arguments from the shell using "Dkey" flags

## Mantis Launcher

We recommend using the mantis-launcher for ease of use, especially if you use standard config on the existing network.

1. To run Mantis using the launcher, navigate to the Mantis binaries root folder (ie. ~/mantis-3.0) and launch with the network name:

```
cd ~/mantis-3.0
./mantis-launcher <config-name>
```

2. Replace `<config-name>` with any network you want to connect to and load the predefined network config, which should include the corresponding `/chains/<chain-name>.conf` file. See [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/blob/develop/src/main/resources/application.conf#L284) for more.

> Note: The main function of the mantis-launcher calls the `-Dconfig.file` configuration option with any parameter being passed to it.

## Using the Dkey

To change config options at runtime on the command line, you can use Dkey arguments to define the key and the value as follows:

```
./mantis-launcher etc -Dkey=value
```

## Data folder

By default, the blockchain data, logs, keystore, and all other files that Mantis creates are stored in the user’s home folder under a subfolder called `.mantis`. Each network will have its own subfolder, that is `etc` (`./mantis/etc`) for the Ethereum Classic mainnet, `mordor` (`./mantis/mordor`) for the testnet data, etc.

### Conf file

You can change settings by going to conf files. There, you can look for or add a mantis.datadir option as follows:

```
mantis {
  # Base directory where all the data used by the node is stored, including blockchain data and private keys
  # datadir = ${user.home}"/.mantis/"${mantis.blockchains.network}
}
```

### Dkey

You can also change this setting by setting a Dkey parameter at runtime:

```
-Dmantis.datadir=/new/datadir/location
```

> Note: You cannot use the `~` shortcut to define the new location.

## Discovery

The discovery function is active by default. The network is queried for additional potential nodes using a partial implementation of the kadelmia discovery protocol.

### Conf file

To prevent this and use *only* the bootstrap nodes as listed in the specific chain configuration go to conf file, find `discovery-enabled` property and set value to `false` to disable the discovery functionality:
`discovery-enabled = false`.

### Dkey
```
-Dmantis.network.discovery.discovery-enabled=true
```

## Fast sync

`Fast sync` can synchronize your local blockchain data faster than a full (or archival) sync. It downloads blocks and only verifies the proof of work of each block instead of downloading and reprocessing every transaction from genesis.

> Note: State tries are downloaded in parallel with blocks and will take considerably longer to do so.

### Conf file
To disable this, you can:

1. Edit the conf file by changing the value of following property: `do-fast-sync` to false
`do-fast-sync = false`

### Dkey
```
-Dmantis.sync.do-fast-sync=false # to run without fast-sync
```

## Pruning

By default, the database is pruned of state trie nodes that are no longer needed. You can prevent this functionality and keep all intermediate state nodes.


### Dkey
```
-Dmantis.pruning.mode=archive
```

## http RPC
Mantis supports all standard web3 JSON-RPC APIs.
To enable the HTTP server,

### Dkey
```
-Dmantis.network.rpc.http.enabled=false
-Dmantis.network.rpc.http.mode=http
```

## Notes:

> All configuration files in Mantis are located in `conf` subdirectory of the Mantis root folder.
> The order of resolving config files is:
>  1. base config - `application.conf`
>  2. `app.conf`
>  3. specific chain config (ex. `mordor.conf`, `etc.conf`, etc)
> (Be aware that files includes the previous ones (via `include` statement) and could override already defined properties so this order is important)
