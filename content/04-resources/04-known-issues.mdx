## Client Issues

* Sometimes, the wallet displays "Latest block not found". The message can appear while the client is synchronizing with the blockchain. In the background, the wallet will begin a controlled retry and continue until the client overcomes the issue. The process will continue until the blockchain is fully synchronized and Mantis is working correctly.
