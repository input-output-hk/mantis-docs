## Client Issues

* Sometimes, the wallet displays "Latest block not found". The message can appear while the client is synchronizing with the blockchain. In the background, the client will begin a controlled retry and continue until it overcomes the issue. Once the error message disappears, the problem is solved, and Mantis is working correctly.
