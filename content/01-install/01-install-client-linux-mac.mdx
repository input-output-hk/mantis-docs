Before you start, the team recommends that you read [Getting Started](/first-steps/getting-started) if you haven't already. It's a 30-second read that will save you time.

Mantis is both a graphical wallet and a command line client. You can download either or both.

This section describes how to install the Mantis client on your Linux or Apple Machine machine. Instructions to install the Mantis wallet are [here](/install/-install-wallet-linux).


## Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites for installing Mantis client:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x.
    To check the JVM version, use
     `java -version`.
    To install Java, follow [these instructions](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
    (Note that  the Mantis team has not tested the wallet with JVM 1.9 or later versions)
* A minimum of 4GB of memory (RAM)
    Additional RAM is needed for the DAG file _if mining_ is enabled.
* 250GB of disk space to ensure fast sync of the node. You will need more than that for the future growth of the chain. You should have an SSD of at least 500GB for full sync.


## Installing Mantis client

To install Mantis, follow these steps:
1. Download the client binary zip archive from  the [Mantis Client page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases/latest):


2. Note the checksum.
> Remember to run checksum verification on your downloads. Refer to these instructions for [Linux](/how-tos/how-check-hash-linux) or [Mac](/how-tos/how-check-hash-mac).

3. Move the zip file to your preferred folder and unzip the client archive file. Finally, remove the zip file.

```
mv mantis-3.1.0.zip /home/<user>/bin/
cd /home/<user>/bin/
unzip mantis-3.1.0.zip
rm mantis-3.1.0.zip
```

4. (Optional) Rename your mantis bin folder for ease of future updates.

```
mv /home/<user>/bin/mantis-3.1.0 /home/<user>/bin/mantis
```

> Default folders for applications are `/home/<user>/Applications` and `/home/<user>/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`. We recommend placing the mantis folder in there.


5. Now, you can run the client from its install folder.

```
bin/mantis-launcher <network name>
```

This command runs the client in the foreground with settings as defined in the `conf` folder files.

The client synchronizes with your chosen network as soon as it starts. The synchronization process can take several hours, depending on the network selected.

For information on the available networks, see [this page](/learn/mantis-client-wallet)

## PATH
6. (Optional, but recommended) Add the binary to your PATH. Add the following line to your `.profile`/`.bashrc`/`.zshrc` (or equivalent). Source the profile file.

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/mantis-3.1.0/bin
source ~/.profile
```

## Updating the Mantis client

To update the Mantis client, replace the Mantis folder with the newer version.

```
mv mantis-<newer-version>.zip /home/<user>/bin/
unzip mantis-<newer-version>.zip /home/<user>/bin/mantis
```
