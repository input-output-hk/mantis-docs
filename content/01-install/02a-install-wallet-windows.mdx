Before you start, the team recommends that you read [Getting Started](/first-steps/getting-started) if you haven't already. It's a 30-second read that will save you time.

Mantis is both a graphical wallet and a command-line client. You can download either or both.

This section outlines how to install the Mantis wallet on your Windows machine. If you want the client, follow the [client installation instructions](/install/-install-client-windows).


## Prerequisites

See [Getting Started](/first-steps/getting-started).

## Installing the wallet

To install Mantis wallet, follow these steps:

1. Choose and download the Windows 64 bit installer from the [wallet release page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis-wallet/releases/latest). the Windows installer is the one with the .exe extension.
2. Note the checksum.
> Remember to run checksum verification on your downloads. Refer to [this section](/how-tos/how-check-hash-windows) for instructions.

3. Execute the binary file to run the installer. It is a standard Windows installer.

> The default installation folder is Program Files/Mantis-Wallet. We recommend placing the Mantis files there.


4. Now, you can run the wallet by double-clicking its executable or running it through your desktop environment. The installation process adds a shortcut to your start menu.

During startup, Mantis wallet allows you to choose the network. The network is the blockchain to synchronize. Here is the splash screen:

For information on the available networks, see [this page](/learn/mantis-client-wallet)

As soon as it starts, Mantis begins synchronizing with the chosen network. In the image, Mantis is using the Sagano Testnet.
