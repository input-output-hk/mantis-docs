# Client and Wallet

Mantis is the node’s *client and a wallet*. You can download them separately and use either according to your needs. They are delivered and released separately, and each has specific installation and configuration options.
Installation materials are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The wallet runs a Mantis client behind the scenes, and the client synchronizes with your chosen network as soon as it starts. The synchronization process can take several hours, depending on the network selected.

Mantis is compatible with the Ethereum Classic mainnet, the Mordor testnet, and other proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum-like networks, including Sagano.

For development, Mantis integrates particularly well with the Sagano testnet. The Sagano testnet includes Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIPs) covering such features as Checkpointing and the Proto-Treasury system.

## Client
