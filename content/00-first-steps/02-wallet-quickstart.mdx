# Mantis Wallet Quickstart

Before you start, the team recommends that you read [Getting Started](/first-steps/getting-started) if you haven't already. It's a 30-second read that will save you time.
> Warning: Mantis Wallet is a beta version and has not been security audited. We recommend you do not carry out transactions with significant ETC amounts when connected to Mainnet.

## Advanced Users

Advanced Users may want to launch the Mantis wallet through command line to pass it extra configuration options with Environment Variables.

Download and run the wallet's packaged binary.

```
cd Applications
wget https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis-wallet/releases/download/untagged-2aa879d1ad64a6b57e5e/Mantis-Wallet-0.1.0.AppImage
```

Run it on by executing the wallet binary.

```
./Mantis-Wallet-0.1.1.AppImage # replace with current version and correct OS option
```

Once the Mantis splash screen has finished loading, visit the `Settings` menu and confirm the network name is correct.

> Note: The wallet runs a Mantis client behind the scenes and will need to synchronize with the network initially. Synchronization might take several hours, depending on the network selected.
