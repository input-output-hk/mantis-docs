Choose whether you'd like to use [the client](#mantisclientquickstart) or [the wallet](#mantiswalletquickstart).

# Mantis Client Quickstart

## Step 1: Get Mantis
To begin, choose your OS and download the [latest release] (https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases/latest).

## Step 2: Run the Client Node
The easiest way to launch the Mantis client is by using the `mantis-launcher` helper script.

In order to run the node, you will first need to choose a network. For this, use one of the command-line options below:

* `etc`: Ethereum Classic mainnet
* `mordor`: Mordor testnet
* `sagano`: Mantis testnet with additional ECIP features

Try running the node on the Mordor testnet:

```
./bin/mantis-launcher mordor # replace with any of the above network names to connect to it
```

**That’s it!** <br/>
The launcher will start downloading blockchain data and synchronizing with the chain.

# Mantis Wallet Quickstart

Download and run the packaged wallet binary.

```
cd Applications
wget https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis-wallet/releases/download/v0.1.0-rc3/Mantis-Wallet-0.1.0.AppImage
```

Double click on AppImage/dmg/exe or run it on CLI.

```
./Mantis-Wallet-0.1.0.AppImage # replace with current version and correct OS option
```

Once Mantis' splash screen is finished loading, head over to the `Settings` menu and make sure you are connected to the correct Network.
